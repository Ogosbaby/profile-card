[# updated-profile-card](https://ogosbaby.github.io/profile-card/)

This project is a continuation of the Stage 0 Profile Card task, expanded into a multi-page application as required for Stage 1.

The application is built using Semantic HTML5, CSS3 (for styling and responsiveness), and Vanilla JavaScript (for dynamic content and form validation).

**Task Overview: Multi-Page Application**
The goal of Stage 1 was to demonstrate proficiency in creating a multi-page, accessible, and responsive web application by building two new pages on top of the existing profile card.

Key Features Implemented:
Stage 0 Profile Card: (Accessible via /index.html) Displays user information and updates the current UTC time in milliseconds dynamically.

Contact Us Page: (Accessible via /contact.html) A form with client-side validation and accessibility features.

About Me Page: (Accessible via /about.html) A reflective page using semantic structure and appropriate headings.

Navigation: A persistent, responsive navigation bar links all three pages.
